## 1. **Pathogen Genomics for Public Health** (Foundations I & II)

We are excited to announce the launch of Pathogen Genomics for Public Health: Foundations I & II, two free, self-paced courses available _anytime_ starting on January 21, 2026. 
 
Join a community of learners building the skills to turn pathogen genomic insights into public health action. As pathogens and outbreaks continue to evolve, these skills are increasingly essential for effective infectious disease response and biosurveillance.

Start with Foundations I: Conceptual Foundations of Pathogen Genomics, an introduction for anyone in public health, or with a general interest in understanding pathogen genomics. In this course, you will discover what pathogen genomics is and why it is becoming an essential tool for tracking infectious diseases and responding to outbreaks. 

Continue with Foundations II: Technical Introduction to Pathogen Genomic Epidemiology: Mutations, Transmission, and Phylogenetics for a deeper understanding of key molecular biology principles that underpin genomic epidemiology. You will explore how sequencing pathogen genomes can reveal insights into pathogen transmission-laying the groundwork for more advanced topics.

## 2. **AMD Central Region In-House Training 2026**
#### March 24 & 25, 2026 - St. Paul, MN  - Minnesota Dept. of Health

_Registration Deadline February 24th, 2026_

## [**CLICK HERE**](https://forms.office.com/g/htjZ6kBWYR) to register TODAY! 

This training event will bring together laboratorians and public health professionals from the 9 states in the AMD Central Region for training in next generation sequencing, bioinformatics, and genomic epidemiology.
The training will consist of breakout “tracks” (methods-focused trainings for wet-lab, bioinformatics, and genomic epidemiology) and joint sessions to encourage effective collaboration. This format ensures that participants will receive practical trainings in techniques relevant to their daily work in AMD, as well as the professional skills that are crucial to the success of this multidisciplinary field.

•Laboratory track: methods for sequencing microbial pathogens; managing raw genomic data; and laboratory information management systems (LIMS) for sequencing.

•Bioinformatics track: sequencing data and result management; strategies automating workflows; selecting appropriate bioinformatics methods; AMD Platform Discussion (if available.

•Epidemiology track: principles of genomic epidemiology; genomic data analysis, visualization, and interpretation; and incorporating sequencing data into surveillance and outbreak response.
