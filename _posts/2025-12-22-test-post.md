## Local URLs in project sites {#local-urls}

When hosting a *project site* on GitHub Pages (for example, `https://USERNAME.github.io/MyProject`), URLs that begin with `/` and refer to local files may not work correctly due to how the root URL (`/`) is interpreted by GitHub Pages.

To demonstrate the issue, the following local image will be broken **if your site is a project site:**

![Crepe]({{'/assets/img/crepe.jpg' | relative_url }})
